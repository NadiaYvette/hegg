{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-}
{-|

Defines 'Language', which is the required constraint on /expressions/ that are
to be represented in e-graph and on which equality saturation can be run.

=== Example
@
data Expr a = Sym String
            | Const Double
            | UnOp  UOp a
            | BinOp BOp a a
            deriving ( Eq, Ord, Functor
                     , Foldable, Traversable)

instance Eq1 Expr  where
    ...
instance Ord1 Expr where
    ...

instance Analysis Expr where
    ...

-- meaning we satisfy all other constraints and Expr is! a language
instance Language Expr

-- | A 'Language' is the required constraint on /expressions/ that are to be

-- Recursive data types must be expressed in its functor form to instance
-- 'Language'. Additionally, for a datatype to be a 'Language' (used in
-- e-graphs), note that it must satisfy the other class constraints. In
